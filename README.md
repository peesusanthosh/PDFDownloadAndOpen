# PDFDownloadAndOpen
This is an android application which is used for downloading a PDF file using PDF URL or opening a PDF file using PDF URL

I am using "com.github.barteksc:android-pdf-viewer:2.8.2" for opening PDF file inside mobile application.
You can also use google drive link to open the PDF file but using google drive link will cause some error when your pdf file is large.


You need to change the URL in Main Activity as per your requirement.
